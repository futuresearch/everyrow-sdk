46469380,"CareIgnition | Senior Software Engineer (Generalist) | REMOTE, Chicago (US Only)
Medical billing in America is a black box of fragmented data and inefficiency. At CareIgnition, we are building the transparency layer for healthcare. We transform massive, messy datasets into financial clarity for employers and providers.
We are looking for a pragmatic generalist. You’ll be working across the entire stack: from building customer-facing features in React and Django to architecting data pipelines that process petabytes of medical claims and rates. Crucially, this role involves deep algorithmic and analytical work. You won't just move data; you will implement the logic that makes sense of it.
We value ""generalist"" DNA—engineers who are as comfortable optimizing a SQL query as they are building a clean UI component. If you enjoy solving high-scale data problems that have a direct impact on healthcare affordability, we’d love to talk.
Tech: Python, Django, React, AWS (ECS, Step Functions, Athena), SQL (DuckDB/Polars), Iceberg/Redshift.

We tend to keep meetings to a minimum in order to provide at least five hours of uninterrupted coding time per day. We practice code reviews and apply automated and manual testing.

46469063,"Blueberry Pediatrics | Full-stack Senior or Staff Engineer | REMOTE (US only)
American healthcare is seldom affordable, accessible, or high-quality. We are fixing this for pediatrics. Blueberry is the most affordable option amongst our competitors. We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day.
Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business.
As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team.
We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

46472301,"Cleric | Staff SWE, AI | Staff SWE, Product | Head of Marketing | SF Onsite | $160K-$240K + Equity
Engineers can't keep up with their production environments: dozens of services, dashboards everywhere, alerts firing. The information to diagnose most issues exists, but finding it takes longer than fixing the problem. AI generated code is making this worse.
Cleric is an AI SRE that autonomously investigates production issues and surfaces findings to engineers. It connects to your existing tools, reasons through the evidence, and tells you what's wrong. We believe engineers should ultimately be accountable in production, and our goal is to help them go much faster.
The hard part is making agents reliable when there's no single right answer. We've built evals, memory systems, and feedback loops that improve with every incident. Gartner just named us a Cool Vendor, we are well funded with years of runway, and most importantly the engineers that use our product find it very sticky.
We're hiring the following roles:
- Staff SWE, AI: Build the reasoning engine. Design evals, debug agent behavior (not just code), expand what it can handle. You've built agents and operated distributed systems at scale.
- Staff SWE, Product: Define what AI SRE should be. Spend time with engineers during incidents, find gaps, decide what to build. You've owned products and know production pain.
- Head of Marketing: Engineers love the product but we need to reach more of them. Software engineers are allergic to AI hype, and you'll need to cut through it. Technical background required.

46566849,"Gambit Robotics | Founding Principal / Staff Full-Stack Engineer | NYC | Onsite | Full-time
Hi! I’m Nicole (ex-Google AI), cofounder of Gambit Robotics with Eliot Horowitz (cofounder/CTO MongoDB).
We’re hiring for two founding engineering roles to work directly with us in our NYC office (in-person only):
1) Founding Principal / Staff Full-Stack Engineer
   - 8+ years experience shipping production systems
   - Strong backend and systems foundation
   - Experience owning architecture end-to-end (zero → production)
2) Founding Full-Stack Engineer
   - 4–6 years experience building and shipping production products
   - Strong product sense and ownership
   - Comfortable working across backend, client, and infrastructure

Gambit is an AI-powered kitchen assistant that mounts magnetically under most range hoods or microwaves. It uses computer vision, thermal imaging, and on-device AI to understand what’s happening in the pan in real time, and handles the hardest parts of cooking — heat, timing, and doneness — so people get better results with less stress.
We’re moving quickly from prototype to product and launching via Kickstarter later this month. It’s a seed-stage startup with high autonomy, real impact, and a very intense (and fun) next phase.
If you or someone you know might be a fit, email me:

Flutter/Shorebird founder here. Flutter is used by millions of devs (and nearly ⅓ of free apps submitted to AppStore), but is missing services for businesses. We offer Flutter-related SAAS used by 1000s businesses globally, on track to profitability early 2026.
As part of our over-the-air updates “code push” product, we’ve built a custom compiler and runtime for the Dart language, primarily written by me (founder/CEO).  Now that we have thousands of customers, I have many other responsibilities and need to bring on a fulltime engineer (you!) to take over primary responsibility for all of our C++ code (Dart & Flutter forks, custom runtime, compiler, etc.) and evolve it further than I could alone.

You do need to be capable of working on large open source projects, be comfortable with C++, want to work at a startup, work well independently (we’re remote) and want to learn and work on lots of different areas of code.

Only apply if you are legally eligible to work in Canada.
We’re looking for someone who is (or can quickly become) strong in end-to-end LLMOps: building and optimizing LLM pipelines, managing inference performance, improving reliability, and supporting production AI features. You’ll work closely with our Staff Engineer and Data Engineer on a small, highly technical team.
We don’t have hard requirements around degrees or specific model frameworks - but you do need hands-on experience with LLMs, vector databases, embeddings, prompt optimization, and deploying/maintaining ML systems in production. Part of the process includes a practical take-home assignment (real-world, not leetcode), followed by technical conversations with engineering leadership.
We’re looking for someone who can think in systems, make good architectural decisions, and operate with a high level of ownership. Thrive is not a place where work is micromanaged - you’ll thrive here (pun intended) if you’re proactive, self-directed, and comfortable moving quickly without rigid structure.
