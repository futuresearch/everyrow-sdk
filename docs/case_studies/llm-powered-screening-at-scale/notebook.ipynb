    "# LLM-powered Screening at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "The everyrow `screen()` function filters a dataframe by applying LLMs, and LLM research agents, to every row to determine if the criteria are met. This notebook demonstrates how this scales to screening 10,000 rows. Since tricky rows get LLM agents that themselves make dozens of LLM calls, this results in running vastly more LLM calls than is generally feasible without dedicated orchestration or infrastructure. The total cost is ~$0.001 per row."
