# everyrow MCP Server

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for [everyrow](https://everyrow.io): agent ops at spreadsheet scale.

This server exposes everyrow's 5 core operations as MCP tools, allowing LLM applications to screen, rank, dedupe, merge, and run agents on CSV files.

**All tools operate on local CSV files.** Provide absolute file paths as input, and transformed results are written to new CSV files at your specified output path.

## Installation

The server requires an everyrow API key. Get one at [everyrow.io/api-key](https://everyrow.io/api-key) ($20 free credit).

### Claude Desktop

Download the latest `.mcpb` bundle from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/futuresearch/everyrow-sdk/releases) page and double-click to install in Claude Desktop. You'll be prompted to enter your everyrow API key during setup.

> **Note:** The MCPB bundle works in Claude Desktop's **Chat** mode. Due to a [known limitation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/20377), local MCP servers are not currently exposed in Cowork mode.

### Cursor
Set the environment variable in your terminal shell before opening cursor. You may need to re-open cursor from your shell after this. Alternatively, hardcode the api key within cursor settings instead of the hard-coded `${env:EVERYROW_API_KEY}`
```bash
export EVERYROW_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=everyrow&config=eyJlbnYiOnsiRVZFUllST1dfQVBJX0tFWSI6IiR7ZW52OkVWRVJZUk9XX0FQSV9LRVl9In0sImNvbW1hbmQiOiJ1dnggZXZlcnlyb3ctbWNwIn0%3D)

### Manual Config

Either set the API key in your shell environment as mentioned above, or hardcode it directly in the config below. Environment variable interpolation may differ between MCP clients.

```bash
export EVERYROW_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Add this to your MCP config. If you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everyrow": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["everyrow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "EVERYROW_API_KEY": "${EVERYROW_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, install with pip (ideally in a venv) and use `"command": "everyrow-mcp"` instead of uvx.

## Workflow

All operations follow an async pattern:

1. **Start** - Call an operation tool (e.g., `everyrow_agent`) to start a task. Returns immediately with a task ID and session URL.
2. **Monitor** - Call `everyrow_progress(task_id)` repeatedly to check status. The tool blocks ~12s to limit the polling rate.
3. **Retrieve** - Once complete, call `everyrow_results(task_id, output_path)` to save results to CSV.

## Available Tools

### everyrow_screen

Filter CSV rows based on criteria that require judgment.

```
Parameters:
- task: Natural language description of screening criteria
- input_csv: Absolute path to input CSV
- response_schema: (optional) JSON schema for custom response fields
```

Example: Filter job postings for "remote-friendly AND senior-level AND salary disclosed"

### everyrow_rank

Score and sort CSV rows based on qualitative criteria.

```
Parameters:
- task: Natural language description of ranking criteria
- input_csv: Absolute path to input CSV
- field_name: Name of the score field to add
- field_type: Type of field (float, int, str, bool)
- ascending_order: Sort direction (default: true)
- response_schema: (optional) JSON schema for custom response fields
```

Example: Rank leads by "likelihood to need data integration solutions"

### everyrow_dedupe

Remove duplicate rows using semantic equivalence.

```
Parameters:
- equivalence_relation: Natural language description of what makes rows duplicates
- input_csv: Absolute path to input CSV
- output_path: Directory or full .csv path for output
```

Example: Dedupe contacts where "same person even with name abbreviations or career changes"

### everyrow_merge

Join two CSV files using intelligent entity matching.

```
Parameters:
- task: Natural language description of how to match rows
- left_csv: Absolute path to primary CSV
- right_csv: Absolute path to secondary CSV
- merge_on_left: (optional) Column name in left table
- merge_on_right: (optional) Column name in right table
- use_web_search: (optional) "auto", "yes", or "no"
```

Example: Match software products to parent companies (Photoshop -> Adobe)

### everyrow_agent

Run web research agents on each row of a CSV.

```
Parameters:
- task: Natural language description of research task
- input_csv: Absolute path to input CSV
- response_schema: (optional) JSON schema for custom response fields
```

Example: "Find this company's latest funding round and lead investors"

### everyrow_progress

Check progress of a running task.

```
Parameters:
- task_id: The task ID returned by an operation tool
```

Blocks ~12s before returning status. Call repeatedly until task completes.

### everyrow_results

Retrieve and save results from a completed task.

```
Parameters:
- task_id: The task ID of the completed task
- output_path: Full absolute path to output CSV file (must end in .csv)
```

Only call after `everyrow_progress` reports status "completed".
