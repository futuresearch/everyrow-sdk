It is a beneficiary of the reshoring trend (providing water and hygiene solutions to new US industrial plants, including semiconductor fabs) [24, 45]. While it has some China exposure (~8.5% of revenue from Asia Pacific), its strategic importance to US industrial water management and reshoring makes it a plausible ""maybe,"" but the prompt asks for companies that see increased revenue from tensions. Ecolab\'s growth is more broadly tied to US industrial re-investment [24]. On balance, it fits the recurring revenue criteria perfectly but the tension benefit is indirect.', 'passes': 'Ecolab meets the criteria. Approximately 90% of its revenue is recurring, derived from long-term service contracts and consumables. It is a direct beneficiary of the US industrial reshoring trend, providing mission-critical water management and hygiene solutions for new domestic semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) and other advanced manufacturing facilities. Its China revenue exposure is approximately 4.43% of total revenue, which is below the 5% threshold, and it is not dependent on Taiwan-based manufacturing.
